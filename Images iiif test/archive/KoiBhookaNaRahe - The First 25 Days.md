In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, an alliance of volunteer groups and NGOs in Bidar, including the Humanitarian Relief Society, Reshine Organisation, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH), Bidar Revolution, Team YUVAA, Jilla Samagra, and Abhivrudhi Horata Samithi, stepped up to provide aid to those in need.

Beginning their efforts in earnest, they pooled resources and started distributing packed food, water bottles, and essential supplies to the poor and needy. By Day 6, they had distributed 310 food packets and water bottles, with the grateful recipients bestowing their heartfelt blessings upon the volunteers. Following the recommendations of food safety officials, they formalized their efforts under the banner of #KoiBhookaNaRahe (May No One Go Hungry), establishing the CovidWarriors (CoronaSainikaru).

Over the course of the following week, Team YUVAA's operations continued to expand. On Day 7, with increased discipline and more people coming forward to help, they distributed food at the Government Hospital premises in Bidar. Thanks to the support of the Humanitarian Relief Society and the Reshine Organisation, they were also able to distribute ration kits at Mailur by Day 8.

The increasing urgency of their mission became clear on Day 9 when an increase in positive cases led to stricter movement restrictions. Despite this, Team YUVAA managed to distribute food and made necessary adjustments to ensure no one went without.

The days rolled on with their efforts remaining steadfast. On Day 13, they provided food at BRIMS hospital for quarantined family members and the needy outside the hospital premises. Day 14 saw Team YUVAA distributing food in Mailoor, and by Day 15, their operations were in full swing across multiple locations.

As they crossed the half-month mark, the CoVIDwarriors continued their work undeterred. Food was distributed daily, and supplies were regularly sent out. Facebook posts and pictures from these days show the tireless dedication of the team.

Within the first 30 days of the lockdown - Team YUVAA with the coalition had successfully implemented a system of distribution that ensured that aid reached those in need.

## Day 7 of the Food Distribution at Giverment Hospital premises Bidar.

More discipline being followed by people. More people taking the food for themselves and their loved ones. More people have started to join hands. More people have started to do it independently as per their capacities in their locality which is a heartening sign. More people supporting and appreciating from Bidar and Outside.

Special mention and special applause to Team Humanitarian Relief society a.k.a HRS@Bidar, for putting in more time in getting this all done. These guys are really fantastic and Reshine organization for facilitating logistics. I heartily thank all the volunteers at NGOConnect Bidar. And all who have been supporting this noble cause.

Ration kits distributed at Mailur.

## Day 8 of the food distribution at Government Hospital, Bidar.

One positive case is all it took to scare the hell out of us. It was being followed up since yesterday, and today morning things started to look really bad. Authorities became really strict and started to restrict all kinds of movement.

They disallowed our passes too till further notice. And we started to think how to keep this going as the need is only getting bigger. But fortunately, the test report of the sample sent yesterday came out negative and things calmed down. But still a worrying sign and indication of things to come.

We finished today's distribution.

For the first time, we fell short as there were too many people who were waiting for the food. We made other adjustments later in the night for them all. We just pray it doesn't come to our places, with prayers for the entire world too that this passes us all for the good. Thank you for keeping the support and encouragement coming.

_Day 11 of the food Distribution at Government Hosptal, Bidar._

It was heartening to see, that the number of people has come down, not that considerably, but still it's a good sign. Administration has started to make arrangements, but we are aware that it will take some time to streamline the services and the delivery system.

Also good to see that many people from Bidar have started to do this in their own surroundings, and also some organizations. It's a relaxing thought for us as at the back of our minds now we feel there are more minds and hands working for the needy ones in Bidar...

But it needs to go on, till we make sure the last person is reached and to make sure that person and his/her family sleeps with their stomachs full.. And we pledge to do it.

Thank you for all the support.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

## Day 13

Day\_13\_of\_the\_food\_distribution @ BRIMS hospital for the quarantined family members of the family members of 11 people from Bidar who are tested positive....

And also to the poor and the needy outside the hospital premises. Today has been a gloomy day for all of us as 11 people were found to be positive for the CoVID virus as per government sources.

Fortunately no positive cases after that. Thank you Shoeb and team HRS for being at it in these difficult times. With prayers for everyone's health in Bidar and across India, we, team members request all to not make this about one community... No one, in the history of mankind, has put their own families at risk in trying to bring damage to others. It's outright foolish and downright bigotry to start to link this to only one place or community.

Let me add that in no way the congregation is being defended, all the people who are part of organising something like that need to be identified and punished as per the laws invoked especially for this situation. The time now is to be with all who are affected and who will be affected( read doctors and staff) due to the stupidity and overconfidence of some fools.

Also, the administration of Bidar is in need of volunteers, which we have been doing presently in our own capacity.. So I appeal to anyone who wishes to come and help District Administartion can reach out to Mr.Rudresh Gaali sir,ADC, Bidar.

It will be our service to Bidar and its people.

Please keep in mind the virus wont see area, religion, gender or age. It can be contracted by anyone.

Be safe and Be Human.
